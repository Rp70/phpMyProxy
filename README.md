# phpMyProxy
phpMyProxy is a free, light and powerful php proxy script programed by eProxies.info. PLEASE use this script to protect your privacy. DON'T BE EVIL!

# It comes back
I'm sorry for a very long time of disappearance of the project. Oh my god, it's 11 years since its first release. I was busy with my job and other projects so I didn't have time to contribute to this script and support the community. While working with a new project, I have a chance to look back old projects and found out that everybody loves phpMyProxy so much. Hence, I decided to push it on github so anybody can download and contribute. This script needs and welcomes you, welcomes your contributions. Feel free to pull & push new changes. Happy coding!

Again, welcomes your contributions.

# Demo
The temporarily demo: http://www.magyc.net/phpmyproxy/. This site wasn't setup by me. Someone did it and keep it almost original. Thanks magyc.net for doing that!
